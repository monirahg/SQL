# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


#CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#Select all columns from Spotify database to know all information available
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#Display number of tracks from each artist 
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS num_tracks
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#Determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability), AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Displayed top 10 artist by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Displayed average popularity for all tracks
SELECT AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#Display rating of popularity per track name
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity,
CASE
WHEN popularity > 90 THEN 'HIT'
WHEN popularity > 75 THEN 'OKAY'
ELSE 'MEH'
END AS popularity_rating
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#Display all tracks by Olivia Rodrigo by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

ORDER BY popularity DESC;

#Display longest track among all 
SELECT track_name, artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
