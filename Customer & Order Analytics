#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as febsales
ON cust.order_id = febsales.orderid;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as rev, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), product,
SUM(quantity)*price as rev
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity)*price as avg
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as febsales
LEFT INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust
ON febsales.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE febsales.Quantity > 2;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
